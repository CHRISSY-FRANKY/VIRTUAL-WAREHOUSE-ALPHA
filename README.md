# Virtual Warehouse :desktop_computer::factory:

Software that enables you to design, visualize, and explore a warehouse. 

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

My current position at GameStop HQ is quality control. Whenever an item in a package has been misplaced, I either have to look for it or return it back to where it belongs. It would be nice if there was a digital map that would enable me to navigate the warehouse and locate the item location.

## Technical Details :wrench:

C++, OpenGL

## Mathematical Foundations :abacus:

To understand the code to be written I advise your knowledge in the following branches of mathematics are well established. I'll have to review the following since teachers' only job is to have you pass their class. 

- Trigonometry
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Graph Theory

## To Do :ballot_box_with_check:

- Enable the user to navigate the warehouse
  - a lot of stuff
