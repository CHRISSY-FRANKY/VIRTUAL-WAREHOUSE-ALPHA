# Virtual Warehouse :desktop_computer::factory:

Software that enables you to design, visualize, and explore a warehouse. 

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

My former position at GameStop HQ was quality control. I got fired because I entered a hazard zone without anyone warning me of the hazard zone. Whenever an item in a package has been misplaced, I either went to look for it or return it back to where it belongs. It would be nice if there was a digital map that would have enabled me to navigate the warehouse and locate the item location.

## Technical Details :wrench:

C#, UnityEngine

## To Do :ballot_box_with_check:
